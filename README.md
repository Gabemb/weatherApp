# weatherApp

You will need to sign up for your own client ID and client secret from [Aeris Weather](http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/) to run the app.

You will then need to create a `private` folder in the root directory and create a file called `config.js` inside of it.

Your `config.js` should look something like this:

```
export default { id: 'ID',
 secret:'SECRET' };
```

Start app with `npm start`</br>
View app at http://localhost:3333/
